Unfolding cubes with non-flat tops in p5
=========================================

This code is dealing with unfolding the cube in most effective way for paper folding.
You can check how this code enables the fabrication over here  [http://itp.nyu.edu/~hj657/blog/parametric-design-broken-scape](http://itp.nyu.edu/~hj657/blog/parametric-design-broken-scape)


This returns development like this :

This code was done for Parametric Design for Digital Fabrication class, NYU ITP, 2013.
